SQL Portfolio (SQL analysis of customer behavior, revenue trends, and cohort retention)

SQL E-Commerce Analytics Project
Overview

This project showcases SQL queries written by me to analyze revenue performance, customer behavior, and retention patterns using an e-commerce dataset. The goal is to answer common business and product analytics questions using practical, real-world SQL techniques.

Business Questions Addressed
How has revenue changed month over month?
What percentage of customers place more than one order?
Which products generate the most revenue?
How has Average Order Value (AOV) changed over time?
What percentage of total revenue comes from the top 10 customers?
How do customers rank by total revenue contribution?
How long does it take customers to place a second order?
What is the repeat purchase rate by customer cohort month?

Tools & Skills Demonstrated
SQL (SQLite syntax)

Joins and aggregations
Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Date and time analysis
Cohort-based retention analysis
Business metric calculation (revenue, AOV, retention rate)

Files
analysis_queries.sql — Contains all SQL queries authored for this project, organized by business question with comments for clarity.

Notes
All queries were written independently and executed locally using DB Browser for SQLite.
The dataset structure reflects a typical e-commerce schema (orders, order items, customers, products).

Purpose
This project is part of my data analytics portfolio and is intended to demonstrate hands-on SQL proficiency, analytical thinking, and the ability to translate business questions into actionable insights.
